DIALECT project repo


This repo contains notebooks:
* [wiki.ipynb](wiki.ipynb) downloads Wikipedias in different languages and extracts raw texts. Next, it creates frequence distibutions for each language and seed lists for languages other than German. Seeds are those words, which occur frequently in one of the languages, but not in German.
